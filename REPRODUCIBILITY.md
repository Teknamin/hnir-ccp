# Reproducibility

This document provides instructions for reproducing the evaluation results presented in the HNIR-CCP project.

*(This section will be updated in Phase 3 with detailed instructions, pinned dependencies, and one-command evaluation run scripts.)*

## Environment

To ensure reproducibility, all experiments are run in a containerized environment with pinned dependencies.

*(Details of the environment and how to build it will be provided here.)*

## Datasets

The evaluation is run against a set of standardized datasets, which will be made available in the `eval/` directory.

*(Links to and descriptions of the datasets will be provided here.)*

## Running the Evaluation

A single command will be provided to run the full evaluation harness and generate the results.

*(The command and its expected output will be provided here.)*
