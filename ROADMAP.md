# HNIR-CCP Roadmap

This document outlines the long-term vision and high-level roadmap for the HNIR-CCP project. It is a living document that will evolve as the project matures and as we receive feedback from the community.

## High-Level Goals

*   **v1 (Current Scope):** Establish the core CCP architecture, provide a reference implementation, and deliver a comprehensive evaluation harness to validate the core theses of the project.
*   **v2 (Future):** Expand the library of deterministic control primitives, develop more sophisticated miss-clustering and rule-suggestion workflows, and explore integrations with additional LLM agent frameworks.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** To establish CCP as a standard, community-driven safety middleware layer for building reliable, production-grade agentic AI systems.

*(This document will be updated as the project progresses.)*
